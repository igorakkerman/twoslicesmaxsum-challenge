# Two Slices Max Sum

### Task
Given an array of integers _a_ and two positive integers _k_,_l_,
find the maximum sum of the elements 
of two disjoint slices of _a_ of size _k_ and _l_, in that order, respectively (_k_-slice before _l_-slice).

If no such two slices exist, the result should be _-1_.

### Examples
#### Example 1
_a = [7, 8, 1, 4, 9, 4, 9, 8]_  
_k = 2_  
_l = 3_

_result = (7 + 8) + (9 + 4 + 9) = 37_

#### Example 2
_a = [7, 8, 1, 4, 9, 4, 9, 8]_  
_k = 3_  
_l = 2_

_result = (4 + 9 + 4) + (9 + 8) = 34_

#### Example 3
_a = [1, 2, 3]_  
_k = 2_  
_l = 2_

_result = -1_
